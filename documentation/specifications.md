# CK3 AI Mod: System Architecture

## 1. General System Architecture

### 1.1. Main Components:
   a. CK3 Mod: Game extension for AI integration
   b. n8n: Workflow orchestrator, acting as AI server and managing requests
   c. User Interface: Manages voice and text interactions
   d. Xata: Cloud database, stores conversation history and character data

### 1.2. Data Flow:
   a. CK3 -> CK3 Mod: Real-time game data transmission
   b. CK3 Mod -> n8n: Transmission of game data and user inputs
   c. n8n -> CK3 Mod: Sending generated responses
   d. CK3 Mod -> User Interface: Display of responses and audio playback
   e. User Interface -> CK3 Mod: Capture of user's voice/text inputs

### 1.3. Technology Integration:
   a. CK3 API for accessing game data
   b. GPT-4o-mini (o for omni) as language model
   c. OpenAI Whisper for speech recognition
   d. OpenAI TTS for speech synthesis
   e. Xata as cloud database

### 1.4. Functional Modules:
   a. Context Manager: Maintains current game state and interaction history
   b. Response Generator: Uses AI to create coherent responses
   c. Input Analyzer: Interprets player's voice/text commands

## Key Considerations:

1. n8n Integration: Design efficient workflows in n8n to manage requests between the CK3 mod and the language model, as well as interactions with the Xata database.

2. Latency: Optimize REST calls to maintain a fluid experience, as they may introduce slight latency compared to WebSockets.

3. API Management: Implement effective management of API keys and quotas for various OpenAI services (Whisper, TTS, GPT).

4. Data Synchronization: Ensure game data, conversations, and character states remain synchronized between CK3, n8n, and Xata.
